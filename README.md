Todos manager.

Technologies which I used:
- React;
- Redux; 
- Local Storage;
- Animation;

Information about app functionality 

- add a task (either clicking non “Add” or by pressing Enter);
- complete a task by checking up the checkbox;
- when task is complete, user can see the completion date;
- un-complete a task by un checking the checkbox, in which case the completion date will be hidden; 
- refresh the browser window and all completed tasks will be deleted and wouldn't be displayed on the main page with todos;
- all completed tasks be also automatically removed after 1 minute of completion time
- when the task is marked as completed it moved to the end of the list, where all completed tasks will be ordered by completion time;
